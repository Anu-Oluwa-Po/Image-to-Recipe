# Image-to-Recipe
## Image-to-Recipe Classifier 🍲📸
A Flask-based web app that predicts key attributes of Nigerian dishes from images using machine learning. Built with Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2), a multi-output CNN architecture, and NLP techniques, then deployed on Render 🚀.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Predicts dish name, regional origin (e.g., North, South, East, West, Central), and health rating (Healthy, Moderately Healthy, Not Healthy) from a single image

✅ User-friendly interface powered by Flask

✅ Deep Learning Model (MobileNetV2 + CNN) trained on labeled Nigerian food image dataset

✅ Uses spaCy embeddings to match main ingredients and generate food descriptions via cosine similarity

✅ Deployed online for real-time image-to-recipe predictions using Render

## 🚀 Future Improvements
🔹 Improve model accuracy with advanced architectures and fine-tuning

🔹 Expand regional and ingredient categories for broader coverage

🔹 Add voice or text-based search for ingredient and recipe suggestions
